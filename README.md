### Design Choices <a name="design-choices"></a>

---
In designing this site I took inspiration from...

#### Fonts <a name="fonts"></a>

[Google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) have been used to give typographic style.
font-family: **???** is used for most text on the site.
font-family: **???** is used for special sans-serif fonts such as the pre-header and footer where a more compact and stylish font are desired.

#### Icons <a name="icons"></a>

[Bootstrap Icons](https://icons.getbootstrap.com/) free icons have been used throughout this project.

#### Colors <a name="colors"></a>

The website colors were chosen using [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/). The justification is...

## Wireframes and Flowcharts <a name="wireframes-and-flowcharts"></a>

### Wireframes <a name="wireframes"></a>

Wireframing was done using Balsamiq under full-functional trial provided by Code Institute.
Wireframes were developed for a [main page](wireframes/wf-home-page-rev-0-1.png), [standard section page](wireframes/wf-electrical-design-page-0-1.png) and a [contact page](wireframes/wf-contact-page-rev0-1.png).
As the design progressed however, the site diverged significantly from multipage model to a single scolling site with all content on a single page.

### Design

* The design of the site was inspired by a combination of a craftshop in my locality that sells a lot of unique, locally produced goods and the Boutique Ado tutorial project on the CI course. Simplicity of design was important throughout with a calm color palette. Accessible contact details are there also for people who feel more comfortable contacting the business directly with any queries.

### Contact form

* The contact form was provided to allow a quick way of a person contacting the store with a simple question outside of normal office hours. Typically, online shopping may be conducted in the evening time or international customers may prefer not to dial an international number.

## Bugs <a name="bugs"></a>

---

Many bugs were encountered during the development of the project - all admittedly of my own making while trying to learn Django.

### Development Bugs

* BugFix:  Issue with AllAuth password authentication found. Error found in Settings.py AUTH_PASSWORD_VALIDATORS. Important note here is to ensure the correct version of Allauth is installed. (Currently 0.43.0.)
* Bugfix:  Used the variable product_id rather than product.id in the product detail anchor. This created some very strange error messages that took a long time to figure out what I had done wrong. The fix is described in the CI Boutique Ado tutorial.
* Bugfix:  Missing 'url' term from Django template link in base.html caused a synthax error. This took quite a while to figure out what I had done.
* BugFix:  Missing single quotes around search term in views.py caused a synthax error on implementation of the search bar. This is was obvious enough from the error message and quickly fixed.
* BugFix:  Error on variable name 'categories' in products/views.py. Incorrectly named 'category' and threw error message.
* BugFix:  Serious issues encountered trying to connect Heroku with AWS's S3 bucket. Many setting configurations were attempted. Solution was found to be an incorrectly assigned BASE_DIR in settings.py. Once this was corrected, static files were transferred to AWS and the deployed site loaded the correct css styles.


### Testing Bugs

* A few bugs were thrown up by the HTML Validator and CSS Validator. The solutions are given above in the **HTML Test** and **CSS Test** Sections.

### Special Thanks

* My Code Institute mentor, [Simen Daehlin](https://github.com/Eventyret), for a lot of great advice and direction along the way. His time, effort and experience made a huge difference to the code quality, readability and end result. It would be hard to overstate his input here.
